## Getting started

### 1. Clone the Repository

#### HTTPS

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/amit-amsl/file-uploader.git
```

#### SSH

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:amit-amsl/file-uploader.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
cd file_uploader
npm install
```

### 3. Set up an account on [Cloudinary](https://www.cloudinary.com/)

Find the cloud name, API key and API secret associated with your account. They will be used as env variables in the next stage.

### 4. Set up environment variables

Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables. Adjust the values according to your environment:

```shell
# Server
NODE_ENV=<production-or-development>

# Database
DATABASE_URL=<postgresql://<your-db-username>:<your-db-password>@db:5432/suredrive_app?schema=public>

# Auth
SESSION_SECRET=<your-session-secret-min-32-chars>

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your-cloudinary-credentials>
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your-cloudinary-credentials>
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<your-cloudinary-credentials>
```

### 5. Set up a local development database

Open a terminal and create a new database in psql.

```bash
psql
CREATE DATABASE <your_database_name>;
# Connect to database
\c <your_database_name>
```

Open another terminal, cd to the project's directory and migrate the database schema.

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
```

In the psql terminal, check that the schema has been successfully migrated over to the development db.

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev
```

### 6. Start development server

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000 by default.
Have fun!
